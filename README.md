## What is Bug Net?
  Bug Net is a small datapack that allows you to capture and release mobs through the use of the Bug Net, a new item crafted with 3 string, a copper ingot, and a stick. Right-clicking a mob with the Bug Net picks them up and afterwards they can be placed back down. By right-clicking another mob with a full Bug Net you can stack them ontop of each other!

  Using the Bug Net brings limitless posibilities and the pack is highly configurable! Run the command: `/function bugnet:commands/gamerules` to bring up the gamerules menu and modify what mobs can and can't be picked up. Want to modify even more? Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/RagtimeGal/Bug-Net/wiki) to find a tutorial on how to edit more directly what mobs can and cannot be picked up!
